"Part of the Commission with mixed support Mixed external support Opposition 189 The European Parliament EP is one of the two legislative bodies of the European Union EU and one of its seven institutions. Together with the Council of the European Union known as the Council and informally as the Council of Ministers, it adopts European legislation, following a proposal by the European Commission. The Parliament is composed of 720 members MEPs, after the June 2024 European elections, from a previous 705 MEPs. It represents the second-largest democratic electorate in the world after the Parliament of India, with an electorate of around 375 million eligible voters in 2024.456 Since 1979, the Parliament has been directly elected every five years by the citizens of the European Union through universal suffrage. Voter turnout in parliamentary elections decreased each time after 1979 until 2019, when voter turnout increased by eight percentage points, and rose above 50 for the first time since 1994.7 The voting age is 18 in all EU member states except for Malta, Belgium, Austria and Germany, where it is 16, and Greece, where it is 17.8 The European Parliament has legislative power in that the adoption of EU legislation normally requires its approval, and that of the Council, in what amounts to a bicameral legislature. However, it does not formally possess the right of initiative i.e. the right to formally initiate the legislative procedure in the way that most national parliaments of the member states do, as the right of initiative is a prerogative of the European Commission.910 Nonetheless, the Parliament and the Council each have the right to request the Commission to initiate the legislative procedure and put forward a proposal.11 The Parliament is, in protocol terms, the first institution of the European Union mentioned first in its treaties and having ceremonial precedence over the other EU institutions,12 and shares equal legislative and budgetary powers with the Council except on a few issues where special legislative procedures apply. It likewise has equal control over the EU budget. Ultimately, the European Commission, which serves as the executive branch of the EU, is accountable to Parliament. In particular, Parliament can decide whether or not to approve the European Councils nominee for President of the Commission, and is further tasked with approving or rejecting the appointment of the Commission as a whole. It can subsequently force the current Commission to resign by adopting a motion of censure.9 The president of the European Parliament is the bodys speaker and presides over the multi-party chamber. The five largest political groups are the European Peoples Party Group EPP, the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats SD, Patriots for Europe PfE, the European Conservatives and Reformists Group ECR, and Renew Europe Renew. The last EU-wide election was held in 2024. The Parliaments headquarters are officially in Strasbourg, France,13 and has its administrative offices in Luxembourg City. Plenary sessions are normally held in Strasbourg for four days a month, but sometimes there are additional sessions in Brussels,14 while the Parliaments committee meetings are held primarily in Brussels, Belgium.1415 In practice, the Parliament works three weeks per month in Brussels and one week four days in Strasbourg.",politics,wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament
"The 2024 Summer Olympics French Les Jeux Olympiques dété de 2024, officially the Games of the XXXIII Olympiad French Jeux de la XXXIIIe olympiade de lère moderne and branded as Paris 2024, were an international multi-sport event held in France from 26 July to 11 August 2024, with several events starting from 24 July. Paris was the host city, with events mainly football held in 16 additional cities in metropolitan France, including the sailing centre in the second-largest city of France, Marseille, on the Mediterranean Sea, as well as one subsite for surfing in Tahiti, French Polynesia.4 Paris was awarded the Games at the 131st IOC Session in Lima, Peru, on 13 September 2017. After multiple withdrawals that left only Paris and Los Angeles in contention, the International Olympic Committee IOC approved a process to concurrently award the 2024 and 2028 Summer Olympics to the two remaining candidate cities. Having previously hosted in 1900 and 1924, Paris became the second city ever to host the Summer Olympics three times, after London 1908, 1948, and 2012.56 Paris 2024 marked the centennial of the 1924 Summer Games and the 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix the first Winter Olympics, as well as the sixth Olympic Games hosted by France three Summer Olympics and three Winter Olympics. The Summer Games returned to the traditional four-year Olympiad cycle, after the 2020 edition was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Paris 2024 featured the debut of breaking as an Olympic sport,7 and was the final Olympic Games held during the IOC presidency of Thomas Bach.8 The 2024 Games were expected to cost 9 billion.91011 The opening ceremony was held outside of a stadium for the first time in modern Olympic history, being outdoors in the Pariss downtown and athletes were paraded by boat along the Seine. Paris 2024 was the first Olympics in history to reach full gender parity on the field of play, with equal numbers of male and female athletes.12 The United States topped the medal table for the fourth consecutive Summer Games and 19th time overall, with 40 gold and 126 total medals.13 China tied with the United States on gold 40, but finished second due to having fewer silvers the nation won 91 medals overall. This was the first time a gold medal tie had occurred between the two most successful nations in Summer Olympic history.14 Japan finished third with 20 gold and 45 total medals, and sixth in the overall medal count. Australia finished fourth with 18 gold and 53 total medals, marking the nations most successful Summer Olympics of all time, and fifth in the overall medal count. The host nation, France, finished fifth with 16 gold and 64 total medals, marking their first top-five finish since the 1996 Summer Olympics, and fourth in the overall medal count. Dominica, Saint Lucia, Cape Verde and Albania won their first-ever Olympic medals, the former two both being gold, with Botswana and Guatemala also winning their first-ever gold medals. The Refugee Olympic Team also won their first-ever medal, Cindy Ngamba, a refugee from Cameroon, winning a bronze in boxing. Despite some controversies throughout relating to politics, logistics and conditions in the Olympic Village, the games were considered a success by the press, Parisians and observers upon its conclusion.a The Paris Olympics broke all-time records for ticket sales, with more than 9.5 million tickets sold 12.1 million including the Paralympic Games.15 Having previously hosted the 1900 and 1924 Games, Paris did not attempt to host the Olympics again until it bid, unsuccessfully, for the 1992 Games which were awarded to Barcelona. Subsequent bids for the 2008 and 2012 Games were also unsuccessful, as they were awarded to Beijing and London, respectively. Undeterred, Paris decided to bid once more for the 2024 edition, which would mark the centenary of its last Games. The six candidate cities were Paris, Hamburg, Boston, Budapest, Rome, and Los Angeles. The bidding process was slowed by withdrawals, political uncertainty, and rising costs. Boston surpassed Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., for the official U.S. bid. On 27 July 2015, Boston and the USOC mutually agreed to terminate Bostons bid to host the Games, partly because of mixed feelings among city residents. Hamburg withdrew its bid on 29 November 2015 after holding a referendum.16 Rome withdrew on 21 September 2016, citing fiscal difficulties.17 Budapest withdrew on 22 February 2017, after a petition against the bid collected more signatures than necessary for a referendum.181920 Following these withdrawals, the IOC Executive Board met on 9 June 2017 in Lausanne, Switzerland, to discuss the 2024 and 2028 bid processes.2122 The International Olympic Committee formally proposed electing the 2024 and 2028 Olympic host cities at the same time, a proposal which an Extraordinary IOC Session approved on 11 July 2017 in Lausanne.22 The IOC set up a process whereby the LA 2024 and Paris 2024 bid committees met with the IOC to discuss which city would host the Games in 2024 and 2028 and whether it was possible to select the host cities for both at the same time.23 Following the decision to award the two Games simultaneously, Paris was understood to be the preferred host for 2024. On 31 July 2017, the IOC announced Los Angeles as the sole candidate for 2028,2425 enabling Paris to be confirmed as host for 2024. The two bids were praised for their high technical plans and innovative ways to use a record-breaking number of existing and temporary facilities. Both decisions were ratified at the 131st IOC Session on 13 September 2017.26",sports,wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Summer_Olympics

"The Super Bowl is the annual league championship game of the National Football League NFL of the United States. It has served as the final game of every NFL season since 1966, replacing the NFL Championship Game. Since 2022, the game has been played on the second Sunday in February. Prior Super Bowls were played on Sundays in early to mid-January from 1967 to 1978, late January from 1979 to 2003a and the first Sunday of February from 2004 to 2021. Winning teams are awarded the Vince Lombardi Trophy, named after the coach who won the first two Super Bowls. Because the NFL restricts the use of its Super Bowl trademark, it is frequently referred to as the big game or other generic terms by non-sponsoring corporations. The day the game is held is commonly referred to as Super Bowl Sunday or Super Sunday. The game was created as part of a 1966 merger agreement between the NFL and the competing American Football League AFL to have their best teams compete for a championship. It was originally called the AFLNFL World Championship Game until the Super Bowl moniker was adopted in 1969s Super Bowl III. The first four Super Bowls from 1967 to 1970 were played before the merger, with the NFL and AFL each winning two. After the merger in 1970, the 10 AFL teams and three NFL teams formed the American Football Conference AFC and the remaining 13 NFL teams formed the National Football Conference NFC. All games since 1971s Super Bowl V have been played between the two best teams from each conference, with the NFC leading the AFC 2827. Among the NFLs current 32 teams, 20 11 NFC, 9 AFC have won a Super Bowl and 16 8 AFC, 8 NFC hold multiple titles. The AFCs Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots have the most Super Bowl titles at six each. The Patriots also have the most Super Bowl appearances at 12, and the most Super Bowl losses at six. The Baltimore Ravens of the AFC and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the NFC are the only franchises to be undefeated in multiple Super Bowls, having each won two. Among the 12 teams who have not won a Super Bowl, the NFCs Detroit Lions and the AFCs Jacksonville Jaguars, Houston Texans, and Cleveland Browns are the only four to have not appeared in the game. The Super Bowl is among the top-ten worlds most-watched sporting events and frequently commands the largest audience among all American broadcasts during the year. Its viewership is bested by the UEFA Champions League final, FIFA World Cup, Tour de France, Cricket World Cup, FIFA Womens World Cup, Summer Olympic Games, and the Winter Olympic games as the most watched sporting event worldwide,1 and the seven most-watched broadcasts in American television history are Super Bowls.2 Its halftime shows feature top artists, the most recent of which being Bad Bunny. Headlining a Super Bowl is considered one of the highest honors in music.32 Commercial airtime during the Super Bowl broadcast is the most expensive of the year because of the high viewership, leading to companies regularly developing their most unique advertisements for the broadcast and commercial viewership becoming an integral part of the event. The Super Bowl is also the second-largest event for American food consumption, behind Thanksgiving dinner.4 Since the turn of the 20th century, college football teams from across the United States have scheduled bowl games against each other. The original bowl game was the Rose Bowl Game in Pasadena, California, which was first played in 1902 as the Tournament EastWest football game as part of the Pasadena Tournament of Roses. In 1923, the Tournament East-West football game moved to the new Rose Bowl Stadium the stadium got its name from the fact that the game played there was part of the Tournament of Roses and that it was shaped like a bowl, much like the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Connecticut. The Tournament of Roses football game thus eventually came to be known as the Rose Bowl Game. Exploiting the Rose Bowl Games popularity, post-season college football contests were created for Miami the Orange Bowl, New Orleans the Sugar Bowl, and El Paso the Sun Bowl in 1935, and for Dallas the Cotton Bowl in 1937. By the time the first Super Bowl was played, the term bowl for any major American football game was well established.5 For four decades after its 1920 inception, the NFL successfully fended off several rival leagues. In 1960, it encountered its most serious competitor when the American Football League AFL was formed. The AFL vied with the NFL for players and fans. After the AFLs inaugural season, AFL commissioner Joe Foss sent an invitation to the NFL on January 14, 1961, to schedule a World Playoff game between the two leagues champions, beginning with the upcoming 1961 season.6 The first World Playoff game, if actually played, would have matched up the AFL champion Houston Oilers against the NFL champion Green Bay Packers.7 In the mid-1960s, Lamar Hunt, owner of the AFLs Kansas City Chiefs, first used the term Super Bowl8 to refer to the AFLNFL championship game in the merger meetings. Hunt later said the name was likely in his head because his children had been playing with a Super Ball toy9 a vintage example of the ball is on display at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. In a July 25, 1966, letter to NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, Hunt wrote, I have kiddingly called it the Super Bowl, which obviously can be improved upon.",sports,wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl

"The G20 or Group of 20 is an intergovernmental forum comprising 19 sovereign countries, the European Union EU, and the African Union AU.23 It works to address major issues related to the global economy, such as international financial stability, climate change mitigation and sustainable development, through annual meetings of heads of state and heads of government.4 The 19 member states of the G20 account for around 85 of gross world product GWP,5 75 of international trade, 56 of the global population,5 and 60 of the worlds land area including the EU and AU, the G20 comprises 78.9 of global population and 83.9 of global CO2 emissions from fossil energy.6 The G20 was founded in 1999 in response to several world economic crises.7 Since 2008, it has convened at least once a year, with summits involving each members head of government or state, finance minister, or foreign minister, and other high-ranking officials the EU is represented by the European Commission and the European Central Bank.89b Other countries, international organizations, and nongovernmental organizations are invited to attend the summits, some permanently. The African Union joined as the 21st member at the 2023 summit in India and was officially represented at the 2024 summit in Brazil. In its 2009 summit, the G20 declared itself the primary venue for international economic and financial cooperation.10 The groups stature has risen during the subsequent decade, and it is recognised by analysts as exercising considerable global influence11 it is also criticised for its limited membership,12 lack of enforcement powers,13 and for the alleged undermining of existing international institutions.12 Summits are often met with protests, particularly by anti-globalization groups.1415 The G20 is the latest in a series of postWorld War II initiatives aimed at international coordination of economic policy, which include institutions such as the Bretton Woods twins, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and what is now the World Trade Organization.16 The G20 was foreshadowed at the Cologne summit of the G7 in June 1999, and formally established at the G7 Finance Ministers meeting on 26 September 1999 with an inaugural meeting on 1516 December 1999 in Berlin. Canadian finance minister Paul Martin was chosen as the first chairman and German finance minister Hans Eichel hosted the meeting.17 A 2004 report by Colin I. Bradford and Johannes F. Linn of the Brookings Institution asserted the group was founded primarily at the initiative of Eichel, the concurrent chair of the G7.18 However, Bradford later described then-Finance Minister of Canada and future Prime Minister of Canada Paul Martin as the crucial architect of the formation of the G20 at finance minister level, and as the one who later proposed that the G20 countries move to leaders level summits.19 Canadian academic and journalistic sources have also identified the G20 as a project initiated by Martin and his American counterpart then-Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.20212223 All acknowledge, however, that Germany and the United States played a key role in bringing their vision into reality.citation needed Martin and Summers conceived of the G20 in response to the series of massive debt crises that had spread across emerging markets in the late 1990s, beginning with the Mexican peso crisis and followed by the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the 1998 Russian financial crisis, and eventually impacting the United States, most prominently in the form of the collapse of the prominent hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in the autumn of 1998.202122 It illustrated to them that in a rapidly globalizing world, the G7, G8, and the Bretton Woods system would be unable to provide financial stability, and they conceived of a new, broader permanent group of major world economies that would give a voice and new responsibilities in providing it.2022 The G20 membership was decided by Eichels deputy Caio Koch-Weser and Summerss deputy Timothy Geithner.

"The North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATOa is an intergovernmental military alliance between 32 member states30 in Europe and 2 in North America. Founded in the aftermath of World War II, NATO was established with the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty in 1949. The organization serves as a system of collective security, whereby its independent member states agree to mutual defence in response to an attack by any outside party. This is enshrined in Article 5 of the treaty, which states that an armed attack against one member shall be considered an attack against them all. Throughout the Cold War, NATOs primary purpose was to deter and counter the threat posed by the Soviet Union and its satellite states, which formed the rival Warsaw Pact in 1955. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the alliance adapted, conducting its first major military interventions in Bosnia and Herzegovina 19921995 and Yugoslavia 1999. Article 5 was invoked for the first and only time after the September 11 attacks, leading to the deployment of NATO troops to Afghanistan as part of the International Security Assistance Force ISAF. The alliance has since been involved in a range of roles, including training in Iraq, intervention in Libya in 2011, and countering piracy. Since the end of the Cold War, the alliance has accepted sixteen new members, incorporating former Warsaw Pact countries and post-Soviet states. NATO and Russia have co-operated, but Russian leaders have called this eastward enlargement a threat to its security interests, and oppose Ukraine joining NATO. The Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 prompted strong condemnation from NATO and a renewed focus on collective defence. The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine led to a major reinforcement of NATOs eastern flank and caused Finland and Sweden to abandon their neutral status and join the alliance. NATO recognizes Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ukraine and Georgia as aspiring members. NATOs main headquarters are in Brussels, Belgium, while its military headquarters are near Mons, Belgium. The combined militaries of all NATO members include approximately 3.5 million soldiers and personnel. Their combined military spending constitutes over half of the global total. Members have committed to a target of spending at least 5 of their gross domestic product GDP on defence to ensure the alliances continued military readiness.5 NATO has its roots in the Atlantic Charter, a 1941 agreement between the United States and United Kingdom. The Charter laid out a framework for international cooperation without territorial expansion after World War II.6 On 4 March 1947, the Treaty of Dunkirk was signed by France and the United Kingdom during the aftermath of World War II and the start of the Cold War as a Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance in the event of possible attacks by Germany. In March 1948, this alliance was expanded in the Treaty of Brussels to include the Benelux countries, forming the Brussels Treaty Organization, commonly known as the Western Union.7 Talks for a wider military alliance, which could include North America, also began that month in the United States, where their foreign policy under the Truman Doctrine set out in 1947 promoted international solidarity against actions they saw as communist aggression, such as the February 1948 coup détat in Czechoslovakia. These talks resulted in the signature of the North Atlantic Treaty on 4 April 1949 by the member states of the Western Union plus the United States, Canada, Portugal, Italy, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland.8 Canadian diplomat Lester B. Pearson was a key author and drafter of the treaty.91011 The North Atlantic Treaty was largely dormant until the Korean War initiated the establishment of NATO to implement it with an integrated military structure. This included the formation of Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe SHAPE in 1951, which adopted many of the Western Unions military structures and plans,12 including their agreements on standardizing equipment and agreements on stationing foreign military forces in European countries. In 1952, the post of Secretary General of NATO was established as the organizations chief civilian. That year also saw the first major NATO maritime exercises, Exercise Mainbrace and the accession of Greece and Turkey to the organization.1314 Following the London and Paris Conferences, West Germany was permitted to rearm militarily, as they joined NATO in May 1955, which was, in turn, a major factor in the creation of the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact, delineating the two opposing sides of the Cold War.15 The building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 marked a height in Cold War tensions, when 400,000 US troops were stationed in Europe.16 Doubts over the strength of the relationship between the European states and the United States ebbed and flowed, along with doubts over the credibility of the NATO defence against a prospective Soviet invasion  doubts that led to the development of the independent French nuclear deterrent and the withdrawal of France from NATOs military structure in 1966.1718 In 1982, the newly democratic Spain joined the alliance.19 The Revolutions of 1989 in Europe led to a strategic re-evaluation of NATOs purpose, nature, tasks, and focus on the continent. In October 1990, East Germany became part of the Federal Republic of Germany and the alliance, and in November 1990, the alliance signed the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe CFE in Paris with the Soviet Union. It mandated specific military reductions across the continent, which continued after the collapse of the Warsaw Pact in February 1991 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union that December, which removed the de facto main adversaries of NATO.20 This began a drawdown of military spending and equipment in Europe. The CFE treaty allowed signatories to remove 52,000 pieces of conventional armaments in the following sixteen years,21 and allowed military spending by NATOs European members to decline by 28 percent from 1990 to 2015.22 In 1990, several Western leaders gave assurances to Mikhail Gorbachev that NATO would not expand further east, as revealed by memoranda of private conversations.23242526 In the 1990s, the organization extended its activities into political and humanitarian situations that had not formerly been NATO concerns.27 During the breakup of Yugoslavia, the organization conducted its first military interventions in Bosnia from 1992 to 1995 and later Yugoslavia in 1999.28",politics,wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO

"This is an accepted version of this page Minority 47 Minority 214 Vacant 3 The United States Congress is the legislative branch of the federal government of the United States. It is a bicameral legislature, including a lower body, the U.S. House of Representatives, and an upper body, the U.S. Senate. They both meet in the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. Members of Congress are chosen through direct election,b though vacancies in the Senate may be filled by a governors appointment. Congress has a total of 535 voting members, a figure which includes 100 senators and 435 representatives the House of Representatives has 6 additional non-voting members. The vice president of the United States, as president of the Senate, has a vote in the Senate only when there is a tie.2 Congressc convenes for a two-year term a Congress, commencing every other January. Each Congress is usually split into two sessions, one for each year. Elections are held every even-numbered year on Election Day. The members of the House of Representatives are elected for the two-year term of a Congress. The Reapportionment Act of 1929 established that there be 435 representatives, and the Uniform Congressional District Act requires that they be elected from single-member constituencies or districts. It is also required that the congressional districts be apportioned among states by population every ten years using the U.S. census results, provided that each state has at least one congressional representative. Each senator is elected at-large in their state for a six-year term, with terms staggered, so every two years approximately one-third of the Senate is up for election. Each state, regardless of population or size, has two senators, so currently, there are 100 senators for the 50 states. Article One of the Constitution requires that members of Congress be at least 25 years old for the House and at least 30 years old for the Senate, be a U.S. citizen for seven years for the House and nine years for the Senate, and be an inhabitant of the state which they represent. Members in both chambers may stand for re-election an unlimited number of times. Congress was created by the Constitutions First Article and first met in 1789, replacing the Congress of the Confederation in its legislative function. Although not legally mandated, in practice members of Congress since the late 19th century are typically affiliated with one of the two major parties, the Democratic Party or the Republican Party, and only rarely with a third party or independents affiliated with no party. Members can also switch parties at any time, though this is uncommon.",politics,wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress

"The United Nations UN is a global intergovernmental organization established by the signing of the UN Charter on 26 June 1945 with the articulated mission of maintaining international peace and security, to develop friendly relations among states, to promote international cooperation, and to serve as a centre for harmonizing the actions of states in achieving those goals. The United Nations headquarters is located in New York City, with several other offices located in Geneva, Nairobi, Vienna, and The Hague. The UN comprises six principal organizations the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, the International Court of Justice, the Secretariat, and the Trusteeship Council which, together with several specialized agencies and related agencies, make up the United Nations System. There are in total 193 member states, representing nearly all of the worlds sovereign states, as well as two observer states, the Holy See and Palestine. The UN has primarily focused on economic and social development, particularly during the wave of decolonization in the mid-20th century. The UN currently operates 11 peacekeeping missions, by order of inception, in the Middle East, Kashmir, Cyprus, the Golan Heights, Lebanon, the Western Sahara, Kosovo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic. The UN has been recognized as a leader of peace and human development, with many officers and agencies having been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, but has also been criticized for perceived ineffectiveness, bias, and corruption. In the century prior to the UNs creation, several international organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross were formed to ensure protection and assistance for victims of armed conflict and strife.4 During World War I, several major leaders, especially U.S. president Woodrow Wilson, advocated for a world body to guarantee peace. The winners of the war, the Allies, met to decide on formal peace terms at the Paris Peace Conference. The League of Nations was approved and started operations, but the United States never joined. On 10 January 1920, the League of Nations formally came into being when the Covenant of the League of Nations, ratified by 42 nations in 1919, took effect.5 The League Council acted as an executive body directing the Assemblys business. It began with four permanent membersthe United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Japan. After some limited successes and failures during the 1920s, the League proved ineffective in the 1930s, as it failed to act against the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1933.citation needed Forty nations voted for Japan to withdraw from Manchuria but Japan voted against it and walked out of the League instead of withdrawing from Manchuria.6 It also failed to act against the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, after the appeal for international intervention by Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie I at Geneva in 1936 went with no avail, including when calls for economic sanctions against Italy failed. Italy and other nations left the League.7 When World War II broke out in 1939, the League effectively closed down.8 The first step towards the establishment of the United Nations was the Inter-Allied Conference in London that led to the Declaration of St Jamess Palace on 12 June 1941.910 By August 1941, American president Franklin Roosevelt and British prime minister Winston Churchill had drafted the Atlantic Charter which defined goals for the post-war world. At the subsequent meeting of the Inter-Allied Council in London on 24 September 1941, the eight governments in exile of countries under Axis occupation, together with the Soviet Union and representatives of the Free French Forces, unanimously adopted adherence to the common principles of policy set forth by Britain and the United States.1112 Roosevelt and Churchill met at the White House in December 1941 for the Arcadia Conference. Roosevelt is considered a founder of the UN,1314 and coined the term United Nations to describe the Allied countries.15 Churchill accepted it, noting its use by Lord Byron.16 The text of the Declaration by United Nations was drafted on 29 December 1941, by Roosevelt, Churchill, and Harry Hopkins. It incorporated Soviet suggestions but included no role for France. One major change from the Atlantic Charter was the addition of a provision for religious freedom, which Stalin approved after Roosevelt insisted.1718",politics,wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations

"The Wimbledon Championships, commonly called Wimbledon,c is a tennis tournament organised by the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in collaboration with the Lawn Tennis Association annually in Wimbledon, London. It is chronologically the third of the four Grand Slam tennis events each year, held after the Australian Open and the French Open and before the US Open. It is the oldest tennis tournament in the world and is widely regarded as the most prestigious.12345 Wimbledon has been held since 1877 and is played on outdoor grass courts it is the only tennis major still played on grass, the traditional surface. It is also the only major that retains a night-time curfew for logistical reasons, with matches continuing until 2300 BST under floodlighting since 2009.6 The tournament traditionally takes place over two weeks in late June and early July, starting either on the last Monday in June or the first Monday in July and culminating with the Ladies and Gentlemens Singles Finals, scheduled for the Saturday and Sunday at the end of the second week. Five major events are held each year, with additional junior and invitational competitions also taking place. In 2009, Wimbledons Centre Court was fitted with a retractable roof to reduce the loss of playing time due to rain. A roof was operational over No. 1 Court from 2019,7 when a number of other improvements were made, including adding cushioned seating, an Aorangi player warm-up area,8 a table and 10 independently operable cameras per court to capture the games. Wimbledon traditions include a strict all-white dress code for competitors, and royal patronage. Strawberries and cream are traditionally consumed at the tournament,9 in latter years accompanied by champagne.10 Unlike other tournaments, advertising is minimal and low-key from official suppliers such as Slazenger and Rolex. The relationship with Slazenger is the worlds longest-running sporting sponsorship, providing balls for the tournament since 1902.11 Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Wimbledon 2020 was cancelled, the first cancellation of the tournament since World War II.12 The rescheduled 134th edition was staged from 28 June 2021 to 11 July 2021. The 135th edition was played between 27 June 2022 and 10 July 2022, and regularly scheduled play occurred in the middle Sunday for the first time. It marked the centenary of the inaugural championships staged at the Centre Court. The ATP, ITF, and WTA did not award ranking points for the 2022 tournament, due to controversy over the tournament excluding players representing Russia and Belarus. The 2025 Wimbledon Championships ran from 30 June to 13 July. For the first time in the tournaments 147-year history, all in-person line judges were replaced by electronic line calling systems. The event also saw a historic British triumph, as Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool became the first all-British mens doubles champions since 1936. The 2026 Wimbledon Championships will run from 29 June to 12 July. The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club is a private club founded on 23 July 1868, originally as The All England Croquet Club. Its first ground was at Nursery Road off Worple Road, Wimbledon.13 In 1876, lawn tennis, a game devised by Major Walter Clopton Wingfield14 a year or so earlier as an outdoor version of real tennis and originally given the name Sphairistikè, was added to the activities of the club. In spring 1877, the club was renamed The All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club and signalled its change of name by instituting the first Lawn Tennis Championship. A new code of laws, replacing the code administered by the Marylebone Cricket Club, was drawn up for the event. Todays rules are similar except for details such as the height of the net and posts and the distance of the service line from the net.",sports,wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships

"The Indian Premier League IPL is a professional Twenty20 T20 cricket league in India, organised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India BCCI.1 Founded in 2007, it features ten city-based franchise teams.2 The IPL is the most popular and richest cricket league in the world and the 13th richest sporting league in the world by revenue. It is held annually between March and May. It has an exclusive window in the Future Tours Programme of the International Cricket Council, resulting in fewer international tours occurring during the seasons.3 It is also the most viewed Indian sports event, per the Broadcast Audience Research Council.45 In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event to broadcast live on YouTube.67 In 2014, it ranked sixth in attendance among all sports leagues.8 Inspired by the success of the IPL, other Indian sports leagues have been established.a1112 The IPL is the second-richest sports league in the world by per-match value, after the National Football League.13 In 2023, the league sold its media rights for the next four seasons for US6.4 billion to Viacom18 and Star Sports,14 which meant that each IPL match was valued at 13.4 million.15 As of 2025, there have been 18 seasons of the tournament. The current champions are the Royal Challengers Bengaluru, who won the 2025 season after defeating the Punjab Kings in the final.

Moreover, the BCCI was unhappy about its committee members joining the ICL executive board.2021 In response, the BCCI increased the prize money for its domestic tournaments and imposed lifetime bans on players who joined the ICL, which it considered a rebel league.2223 On 13 September 2007, as the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 began, the BCCI launched the Indian Premier League, an annual franchise-based Twenty20 cricket competition.24 The inaugural season was scheduled to start in April 2008, commencing with a high-profile ceremony in New Delhi. BCCI vice-president Lalit Modi, who led the IPL initiative, provided details of the tournament, including its format, prize money, franchise revenue system, and squad composition rules.

"This is an accepted version of this page Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union Related Women Brexit ˈbrɛksɪt, ˈbrɛɡzɪt1 a portmanteau of Britain and Exit was the withdrawal of the United Kingdom UK from the European Union EU. Brexit took place at 2300 GMT on 31 January 2020 0000 1 February 2020 CET.a The UK, which joined the EU precursor, the European Communities EC, on 1 January 1973, is the only member state to have withdrawn, although previously the territories of Algeria ceased to be part of the EC following its independence from the member state France in 1962 and Greenland part of the Kingdom of Denmark left the EC in 1985. Following Brexit, EU law and the Court of Justice of the European Union no longer have primacy over British law but the UK remains bound by obligations in treaties it has with other countries around the world, including many with EU member states and with the EU itself. The European Union Withdrawal Act 2018 retains relevant EU law as domestic law, which the UK can amend or repeal. The EU and its institutions developed gradually after their establishment. Throughout the period of British membership, Eurosceptic groups had existed in the UK, opposing aspects of the EU and its predecessors. The Labour prime minister Harold Wilsons pro-EC government held a referendum on continued EC membership in 1975, in which 67.2 voted to stay. Despite growing political opposition by a minority of UK politicians to further European integration aimed at ever closer union between 19752016, from factions of the Conservative Party in the 1980s2000s, no further referendums on the issue were held. By the mid-2010s, the growing popularity of the UK Independence Party UKIP, as well as pressure from Eurosceptics within his own party, persuaded the Conservative prime minister David Cameron to promise a referendum on British membership of the EU if his government was re-elected. Following the 2015 general election, which produced a small but unexpected majority for the governing Conservative Party, the promised referendum on continued EU membership was held on 23 June 2016. Supporters of the Remain campaign included then-prime minister David Cameron, the future prime ministers Theresa May, Liz Truss, and Sir Keir Starmer, and the exprime ministers John Major, Tony Blair, and Gordon Brown supporters of the Leave campaign included the future prime ministers Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak. The electorate voted to Leave the EU by a slight margin, with a 51.9 share of the vote, all regions of England and Wales except London voting in favour of Brexit, and Scotland and Northern Ireland voting to remain. The result led to Camerons sudden resignation, his replacement by former Home Secretary Theresa May, and four years of negotiations with the EU over the terms of departure and future relations, completed under a Boris Johnson-led government, with the Conservative Party in office. The negotiation was both politically challenging and deeply divisive, leading to two snap general elections in 2017 and 2019. One proposal under the second May ministry was overwhelmingly rejected by the UK Parliament, causing great uncertainty and leading to postponement of the withdrawal date to avoid a no-deal Brexit. The UK officially left the European Union on 31 January 2020 after a withdrawal deal was passed by Parliament, but continued to participate in many EU institutions including the single market and customs union during an eleven-month transition period during which it was hoped that details of the post-Brexit relationship could be agreed and implemented. Trade deal negotiations continued within days of the scheduled end of the transition period, and the EUUK Trade and Cooperation Agreement was signed on 30 December 2020. The effects of Brexit in the UK are in part determined by the cooperation agreement, which provisionally applied from 1 January 2021, until it formally came into force on 1 May 2021.2",politics,wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit

"The ICC Mens Cricket World Cup is a quadrennial world cup for cricket in One Day International ODI format, organised by the International Cricket Council ICC. The tournament is one of the worlds most viewed sporting events and considered the flagship event of the international cricket calendar by the ICC.1 The first Cricket World Cup was organised in England in June 1975, with the first ODI cricket match having been played only four years earlier. However, a separate Womens Cricket World Cup had been held two years before the first mens tournament, and a tournament involving multiple international teams had been held as early as 1912, when a triangular tournament of Test matches was played between Australia, England and South Africa. The first three World Cups were held in England. From the 1987 tournament onwards, hosting has been shared between countries under an unofficial rotation system, with 14 ICC members having hosted at least one match in the tournament. The current format involves a qualification phase, which takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase. In the tournament phase, 10 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation, compete for the title at venues within the host nation over about a month. In the 2027 World Cup, the format will be changed to accommodate an expanded 14-team final competition.2 A total of twenty teams have competed in the 13 editions of the tournament, with ten teams competing in the recent 2023 tournament. Australia has won the tournament six times, India and West Indies twice each, while Pakistan, Sri Lanka and England have won it once each. The best performance by a non-full-member team came when Kenya made the semi-finals of the 2003 tournament. Australia are the current champions after winning the 2023 World Cup in India. The subsequent 2027 World Cup will be held jointly in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia. The first international cricket match was played between Canada and the United States, on 24 and 25 September 1844.3 However, the first credited Test match was played in 1877 between Australia and England, and the two teams competed regularly for The Ashes in subsequent years. South Africa was admitted to Test status in 1889.4 Representative cricket teams were selected to tour each other, resulting in bilateral competition. Cricket was also included as an Olympic sport at the 1900 Paris Games, where Great Britain defeated France to win the gold medal.5 This was the only appearance of cricket at the Summer Olympics.6 The first multilateral competition at international level was the 1912 Triangular Tournament, a Test cricket tournament played in England between all three Test-playing nations at the time England, Australia and South Africa. The event was not a success the summer was exceptionally wet, making play difficult on damp uncovered pitches, and crowd attendances were poor, attributed to a surfeit of cricket.7 Since then, international Test cricket has generally been organised as bilateral series a multilateral Test tournament was not organised again until the triangular Asian Test Championship in 1999.8 The number of nations playing Test cricket increased gradually over time, with the addition of West Indies in 1928,9 New Zealand in 1930,10 India in 1932,11 and Pakistan in 1952.12 However, international cricket continued to be played as bilateral Test matches over three, four or five days.",sports,wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup

"Elections were held in the United States on November 5, 2024. In the presidential election, former Republican President Donald Trump, seeking a non-consecutive second term, defeated the incumbent Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. Republicans also gained control of the Senate and held narrow control of the House of Representatives, winning a government trifecta for the first time since 2016.1 This was the third consecutive presidential election in which the incumbent party lost the presidential election 2016, 2020, and 2024. The last time neither the presidency nor a chamber of Congress changed control was in 2012. This was also the first time since 1980 that Republicans flipped control of a chamber of Congress in a presidential year, and that Democrats were voted out after a single four-year presidential term.2 Republicans capitalized on Joe Bidens age, questions about his cognitive health, and his high unpopularity in the midst of inflation despite an initial reelection campaign that collapsed due to poor debate performance against Trump. Democrats, after an unexpectedly strong performance in the 2022 midterms, faced internal divisions over the Gaza war and Israel. This election cycle was notable for two attempted assassinations on Donald Trump, the first in Pennsylvania, in which he was shot, and the second in Florida. This was the first time a U.S. president current or former had been shot at since 1981, and the first time a U.S. presidential candidate had been shot on the campaign trail since 1972. Major issues across the elections were the economy, abortion, immigration, democracy, and foreign policy. During the 2024 election cycle, Donald Trump faced multiple criminal and civil court cases. By December 2022, one month after announcing his re-election bid,3 he had four criminal indictments totaling 86 felony counts.4 Trump and many Republicans made numerous false and misleading statements regarding Trumps criminal trials, including false claims that they are rigged or election interference orchestrated by Biden and the Democratic Party, of which there is no evidence.56 On May 30, 2024, Trump was found guilty by a jury of all 34 felony counts in The People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trump over falsifying business records for hush money payments to pornographic film star Stormy Daniels, to ensure her silence about a sexual encounter between them to influence the 2016 presidential election. This made Trump the first former U.S. president to be convicted of a crime in American history.7 Trump was found liable on May 9, 2023, by an anonymous jury,8 in E. Jean Carroll v. Donald J. Trump for battery and defamation,9 and was ordered to pay a total of 88.3-million combined judgement,10 In September 2023, Trump was found guilty of financial fraud in New York v.

"The UEFA Champions League UCL, usually known simply as the Champions League, is an annual club association football competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations UEFA that is contested by top-division European clubs. The competition begins with a round robin league phase to qualify for the double-legged knockout rounds, and a single-leg final. It is the most-watched club competition in the world and the third most-watched football competition overall, behind only the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship. It is one of the most prestigious football tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champions and, for some nations, one or more runners-up of their national associations. Introduced in 1955 as the European Champion Clubs Cup French Coupe des Clubs Champions Européens, and commonly known as the European Cup, it was initially a straight knockout tournament open only to the champions of Europes domestic leagues, with its winner reckoned as the European club champion. The competition took on its current name in 1992, adding a round-robin group stage in 1991 and allowing multiple entrants from certain countries since the 199798 season.1 While only the winners of many of Europes national leagues can enter the competition, the top 5 leagues by coefficient provide four teams each by default,2 with a possibility for additional spots based on performance during the previous season.34 Clubs that finish below the qualifying spots are eligible for the second-tier UEFA Europa League competition, and since 2021, for the third-tier UEFA Conference League.5 In its present format, the Champions League begins in early July with three qualifying rounds and a play-off round, all played over two legs. The seven surviving teams enter the league phase, joining 29 teams qualified in advance. The 36 teams each play eight opponents, four home and four away. The 24 highest-ranked teams proceed to the knockout phase that culminates with the final match in late May or early June.6 The winner of the Champions League automatically qualifies for the following years Champions League, the UEFA Super Cup, the FIFA Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup.78 Spanish clubs have the most victories 20 wins, followed by England 15 wins, Italy 12 wins, Germany 8 wins, Netherlands 6 wins and Portugal 4 wins.9 England has the most winning teams, with six clubs having won the title. The competition has been won by 24 clubs and 13 of them have won it more than once.10 Since the tournament changed name and structure in 1992, only two top-tier football clubs outside the Big Five European nations Spain, England, Italy, Germany and France have also reached the final Porto 200304 and Ajax 199495 and 199596. Real Madrid is the most successful club in the tournaments history, having won it 15 times.11 Madrid is the only club to have won it five times in a row the first five editions.11 Only one club has won all of their matches in a single tournament en route to the tournament victory Bayern Munich in the 201920 season.12 Paris Saint-Germain are the current European champions, having beaten Inter Milan 50 in the 2025 final for their first ever title.13 The first time the champions of two European leagues met was in what was nicknamed the 1895 World Championship, when English champions Sunderland beat Scottish champions Heart of Midlothian 53.14 The first pan-European tournament was the Challenge Cup, a competition between clubs in the Austro-Hungarian Empire.15 Three years later, in 1900, the champions of Belgium, Netherlands and Switzerland, which were the only existing leagues in continental Europe at the time, participated in the Coupe Van der Straeten Ponthoz, thus being dubbed as the club championship of the continent by the local newspapers.1617 The Mitropa Cup, a competition modelled after the Challenge Cup, was created in 1927, an idea of Austrian Hugo Meisl, and played between Central European clubs.18 In 1930, the Coupe des Nations lit. Nations Cup, the first attempt to create a cup for national champion clubs of Europe, was played and organised by Swiss club Servette.19 Held in Geneva, it brought together ten champions from across the continent. The tournament was won by Újpest of Hungary.19 Latin European nations came together to form the Latin Cup in 1949.20 After receiving reports from his journalists over the highly successful South American Championship of Champions of 1948, Gabriel Hanot, editor of LÉquipe, began proposing the creation of a continent-wide tournament.21 In interviews, Jacques Ferran one of the founders of the European Champions Cup, together with Gabriel Hanot,22 said that the South American Championship of Champions was the inspiration for the European Champions Cup.23 After Stan Cullis declared Wolverhampton Wanderers Champions of the World following a successful run of friendlies in the 1950s, in particular a 32 friendly victory against Budapest Honvéd, Hanot finally managed to convince UEFA to put into practice such a tournament.1 It was conceived in Paris in 1955 as the European Champion Clubs Cup.1 The first European Cup took place during the 195556 season.2425 Sixteen teams participated some by invitation AC Milan Italy, AGF Aarhus Denmark, Anderlecht Belgium, Djurgården Sweden, Gwardia Warszawa Poland, Hibernian Scotland, Partizan Yugoslavia, PSV Eindhoven Netherlands, Rapid Wien Austria, Real Madrid Spain, Rot-Weiss Essen West Germany, Saarbrücken Saar, Servette Switzerland, Sporting CP Portugal, Reims France and Vörös Lobogó Hungary.2425",sports,wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League

The World Cup is globally regarded as the most prestigious association football competition, as well as the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world.23 The viewership of the 2018 World Cup was estimated to be 3.57 billion, close to half of the global population,45 while the engagement with the 2022 World Cup was estimated to be 5 billion, with about 1.5 billion people watching the final match.6 Eighteen countries have hosted the World Cup, most recently Qatar, who hosted the 2022 event. The 2026 tournament will be jointly hosted by Canada, Mexico, and the United States, which will give Mexico the distinction of being the first country to host games in three World Cups. The worlds first international football match was a challenge match played in Glasgow in 1872 between Scotland and England.7 The first international tournament for nations, the inaugural British Home Championship, took place in 1884 and included games between England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland.8 As football grew in popularity in other parts of the world at the start of the 20th century, it was held as a demonstration sport with no medals awarded at the 1900 and 1904 Summer Olympics however, the International Olympic Committee has retroactively upgraded their status to official events, as well as the 1906 Intercalated Games.9 After FIFA was founded in 1904, it tried to arrange an international football tournament between nations outside the Olympic framework in Switzerland in 1906. These were very early days for international football, and the official history of FIFA describes the competition as having been unsuccessful.10 At the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, football became an official Olympic sport. Planned by the Football Association the FA, Englands football governing body, the event was for amateur players only and was regarded suspiciously as a show rather than a competition. Great Britain represented by the England national amateur football team won the gold medals. They repeated the feat at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm.11 With the Olympic event continuing to be a contest between amateur teams only, Sir Thomas Lipton organised the Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy tournament in Turin in 1909. The Lipton tournament was a championship between individual clubs not national teams from different nations, each of which represented an entire nation. The competition is sometimes described as The First World Cup,12 and featured the most prestigious professional club sides from Italy, Germany and Switzerland, but the FA of England refused to be associated with the competition and declined the offer to send a professional team. Lipton invited West Auckland, an amateur side from County Durham, to represent England instead. West Auckland won the tournament and returned in 1911 to successfully defend their title.13 Prior to the Lipton competition, from 1876 to 1904, games that were considered to be the football world championship were meetings between leading English and Scottish clubs, such as the 1895 game between Sunderland A.F.C. and the Heart of Midlothian F.C., which Sunderland won.14",sports,wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup

"The NBA Finals is the annual championship series of the National Basketball Association NBA. The Eastern and Western Conference champions play a best-of-seven series to determine the league champion. The team that wins the series is awarded the Larry OBrien Championship Trophy, which replaced the original Walter A. Brown Trophy in 197677, though under the same name until 1984. The series was initially known as the BAA Finals prior to the 194950 season when the Basketball Association of America BAA merged with the National Basketball League NBL to form the NBA. The competition oversaw further name changes to NBA World Championship Series from 1950 to 1985, as well as a brief stint as the Showdown, before settling on NBA Finals in 1986.1 Since 2018, it has been officially known as the NBA Finals presented by YouTube TV for sponsorship reasons.23 The NBA Finals was initially structured in a 22111 format.4 In 1985, to ease the amount of cross-country travel, it was changed to a 232 format, in which the first two and last two games of the series were played at the arena of the team who earned home-court advantage by having the better record during the regular season.56 In 2014, the 22111 format was restored. The team with the better regular season record hosts the first two games and the other team hosts the next two games. If needed, the remaining three are played at each teams home arena alternately, starting with the arena of the team with the better regular season record.78 A total of 21 franchises have won the NBA Finals, with the Oklahoma City Thunder winning the most recent and earning their first title since relocating to Oklahoma City, and second overall. The beginning era of modern professional basketball was dominated by the Minneapolis Lakers, who won five of the first ten titles. The Philadelphia Warriors also won multiple championships, including the inaugural title in 1947 and another in 1956 to bookend the NBAs first decade. After being founded in 1946, the Basketball Association of America completed its inaugural season in April 1947 with the Philadelphia Warriors defeating the Chicago Stags in the 1947 BAA Finals in five games. The following season the Warriors again reached the Finals, however they fell short to the now defunct Baltimore Bullets.9 To date the Baltimore Bullets are the only defunct team to win a championship. In 1948, the Minneapolis Lakers won the championship of the rival National Basketball League before joining the BAA. Led by future Hall of Famer George Mikan, the Lakers won the third and final BAA championship in 1949 over the Red Auerbach-coached Washington Capitals.1011 The BAA then merged with the NBL to form the National Basketball Association before the 194950 season. The Lakers won the inaugural NBA championship in 1950 to become the first team to repeat as champions. In 1951, the Rochester Royals defeated the New York Knicks in the only Finals contested between two teams from the same state something not possible under the current NBA alignment. This was the first of three consecutive losses in the Finals for the Knicks. Meanwhile, the Lakers won three straight Finals from 1952 to 1954 to become the first team to three-peat while also winning their fifth title in six seasons.12 Of the five franchises to win a championship from 1947 to 1956, one the Bullets folded and the other four the Warriors, Lakers, Royals, and Syracuse Nationals all relocated by 1964.1314",sports,wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals

On 28 May 2023, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, unveiled and inaugurated the New Parliament Building Sansad Bhavan, located adjacent to the previous one. During the British rule, the legislative branch of India was the Imperial Legislative Council, which was created in 1861 via the Indian Councils Act 186145 and disbanded in 1947, when India gained independence. Following independence, the Constituent Assembly of India was elected to write the Constitution of India.6 In 1950 after the constitution came into force, the Constituent Assembly of India was disbanded,7 and succeeded by the Parliament of India, which is active to this day. The Old Parliament House Samvidhan Sadan is located in New Delhi. It was designed by Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker, who were made responsible for the planning and construction of New Delhi by the British government, as the home of the Central Legislative Assembly, the Council of State, and the Chamber of Princes. The construction of the building took six years, and the opening ceremony was performed on 18 January 1927 by the viceroy and governor-general of India, Lord Irwin. The construction cost for the building was 8.3 million US98,000.8 The building is 21 metres 70 ft tall, 170 metres 560 ft in diameter and covers an area of 2.29 hectares 5.66 acres. The Central Hall consists of the chambers of the Lok Sabha, the Rajya Sabha, and the library hall. Surrounding these three chambers is the four-storied circular structure providing accommodations for members and houses parliamentary committees, offices and the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs.8 The center and the focus of the building is the Central Hall. It consists of chambers of the Lok Sabha, the Rajya Sabha, and the Library Hall, and between them lie garden courts. Surrounding these three chambers is the four-storied circular structure providing office spaces for ministers, chairmen, parliamentary committees, party offices, important offices of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha Secretariat, and also the offices of the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs. The Central Hall is circular in shape and the dome is 30 metres 98 ft in diameter. It is a place of historical importance. The Indian Constitution was framed in the Central Hall. The Central Hall was originally used in the library of the erstwhile Central Legislative Assembly and the Council of States. In 1946, it was converted and refurbished into the Constituent Assembly Hall.9 A new parliament building called the Sansad Bhavan was inaugurated on 28 May 2023.10 The old building, an 85-year-old structure suffers from inadequacy of space to house members and their staff and is thought to suffer from structural issues. The building also needs to be protected because of its heritage tag.1112 The new building, with a built-up area of approximately 65,000 sq m and a distinctive triangular shape, optimally utilizes space. It houses an expanded Lok Sabha Hall, accommodating up to 888 seats, and a larger Rajya Sabha hall, accommodating up to 384 seats, with the Lok Sabha capable of accommodating up to 1,272 seats for joint sessions of Parliament. The Lok Sabha Hall draws inspiration from Indias national bird, incorporating a peacock theme, while the Rajya Sabha hall is designed with a lotus theme, reflecting Indias national flower. Additionally, a state-of-the-art Constitutional Hall symbolically and physically places Indian citizens at the heart of democracy. Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation for the new Parliament building on 10 December 2020.1314 With an estimated cost of  9.71 billion, the new building was inaugurated in 2023.1314 The first session in the New Parliament took place on 19 September 2023.15 The Indian Parliament consists of two houses, namely, the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, with the President of India acting as their head.
